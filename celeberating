       <p class="card-text small" style="background-color:#b00707; color: white; width:auto; padding:7px; background-color: black;" >The 50th year celebrations for children were planned, initially, for the week of November 14-20,starting on the Indian Children’s Day (Pt. Nehru’s birthday) and ending onthe International Children’s Day. However, it expanded to a month, to include art workshops, corporate volunteers, gifts for children, and an invitation tothe National School of Drama(NSD) in Delhi!</p>
       
       <p class="card-text small" style="background-color:#b00707; color: white; width:auto; padding:7px; background-color: black;" >The art workshops saw participation by 100 children,in six centres of Mobile Creches spread across Noida, Gurgaon and Delhi. This was done in partnership with Artreach India that connected us tothe talented artist,Moumita Ghosh. She steered the activities to help children create gorgeous wall murals, masks, puppetsand greeting cards,in joyful, vibrant colours[AA1] .

       <p class="card-text small" style="background-color:#b00707; color: white; width:auto; padding:7px; background-color: black;" >We also organized a Sports Day and a Movies’ Day for children in all our centres. Lots of fun and games through the morning – with something for everybody – ending with music and dance. Watching children’s films on Movies’ Day was as much fun for the adults as the children themselves!
